| 1    | **AWS X-Ray**     | Uses Traces: contains data about each request.<br>Creates a service map to see data latencies, HTTP status codes, and metadata.                        | Debug apps on microservices & serverless architectures |
| 2    | **VPC Endpoint**  | Private connection between AWS services and VPC.<br>**Types:**<br>a) Gateway Endpoint:<br>‚Ä¢ Uses route table entries<br>‚Ä¢ For S3 and DynamoDB only<br>‚Ä¢ Basic access control<br><br>b) Interface Endpoint:<br>‚Ä¢ Uses private IP in subnet<br>‚Ä¢ For most AWS services<br>‚Ä¢ Fine-grained access control | ‚Ä¢ Secure private access to AWS services<br>‚Ä¢ Bulk data transfer (Gateway)<br>‚Ä¢ Managed service access (Interface) |
| 3    | **AWS Organizations** | Central Management system for AWS:<br>‚Ä¢ Automate account creation - group these accounts based on business needs<br>‚Ä¢ Apply policies on these groups for governance & security<br>‚Ä¢ Simply billing by setting single payment method | Manage AWS accounts of all units and then share the reserved EC2 instances amongst all units |
| 4    | **EFS**          | File storage system with aws ec2 instances. Provides:<br>‚Ä¢ File system interface<br>‚Ä¢ File system access semantics<br>‚Ä¢ Concurrent accessible storage with upto 1000s of ec2 instances | ‚Ä¢ When EBS/instance store doesn't support multi-instance access<br>‚Ä¢ When S3 doesn't support file append operations<br>‚Ä¢ Mount on instances across multiple AZs |
| 5    | **AWS Shield**    | Prevents AWS services from common network and transport layer DDoS attacks.<br>‚Ä¢ Standard: Free, default for all customers<br>‚Ä¢ Advanced: Customizable rules, 24/7 access to shield response team | Protection for internet-facing applications:<br>‚Ä¢ Route 53<br>‚Ä¢ Global Accelerator |
| 6    | **DynamoDB**      | Serverless, NoSQL, fully managed database with single-digit millisecond performance at any scale.<br><br>Global tables: fully managed, multi-region, multi-active database feature - automatically replicates table data across AWS Regions | Application needs AWS NoSQL database service to support active-active configuration in both East and West US AWS regions |
| 7    | **AWS Glue**      | A serverless data integration service that makes it easy to discover, prepare, and combine data.<br>‚Ä¢ Works like a virtual data expert<br>‚Ä¢ Automatically finds and catalogs your data<br>‚Ä¢ Helps clean and transform data | ‚Ä¢ Converting data formats (like CSV to JSON)<br>‚Ä¢ Combining data from different sources<br>‚Ä¢ Preparing data for analysis |

‚ú® *Tip: For VPC Endpoints, remember: Gateway (S3/DynamoDB, simple) vs Interface (All services, advanced)*

üí° *Tip: Think resource performance monitoring, events, and alerts; think CloudWatch.<br>
Think account-specific activity and audit; think CloudTrail.<br>
Think resource-specific change history, audit, and compliance; think Config.*
